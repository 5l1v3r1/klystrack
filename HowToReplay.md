klystrack songs and instruments can easily be used in the klystron library. For demos and intros, it is possible to use only the audio routines. See the [command line player example](http://code.google.com/p/klystrack/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fplayer).

There is a prebuilt library ([libksnd](http://code.google.com/p/klystron/wiki/libksnd)) that is meant for easy playback of klystrack tunes. The library tries to be small so it is usable for e.g. small intros.

Please consult the [klystron manual](http://code.google.com/p/klystron/wiki/MakingNoise) for more info.
