n00bstar has written [excellent tutorials](http://n00bstar.blogspot.ca/p/klystrack-tutorials.html) that also explain how to create nice instruments, how that relates to music theory, mixing and basic chiptune concepts!

**News:** Takashi Kawano has translated these [in Japanese](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ElRMyQr4zWbDdQYmFwQWl3dTQ/view?usp=sharing)! Thanks!
